# Backend Development Plan

## ✅ Implemented
- Modularize Your Codebase
  - Organized into modules (user, family, tasks, shopping, cars, etc.)
  - Each module has routes, controllers, validations
- Input Validation
  - Custom validation middleware for all entities
  - Validating user inputs in auth and other routes
- Logging
  - Logging middleware exists (logger.js)
  - Important events, errors, and API requests are logged
- Environment Configuration
  - Using dotenv for environment variables
- CORS Configuration
  - CORS configured in the application
- Database Migrations
  - Using Prisma migrations
- Service Layer Coverage
  - Service files for all entities
- Controller Coverage
  - Controller files for all entities
- Route Coverage
  - Route files for all entities
- API Documentation
  - Swagger/OpenAPI configured
- Route Registration
  - All routes registered in main router (server.js)
- Entity Coverage
  - All main entities present in schema and docs

## ⚠️ Partially Implemented
- Modularize Your Codebase
  - Some modules may lack full service implementation (e.g., shopping, cars)
- API Documentation
  - Endpoints documented in Swagger
  - Request/response schemas, authentication requirements, and examples need improvement
- Standardized API Responses
  - Some endpoints use standardized responses, but not all
- RBAC Enforcement
  - JWT authentication implemented
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) using UserRole enum is present in some endpoints, but not enforced everywhere
- Error Handling
  - Global error handler middleware exists
  - Custom error classes (`ApiError`, `NotFoundError`) missing
  - HTTP status codes not fully standardized
- API Response Format
  - Some endpoints use standardized responses, but not all
- Documentation Coverage
  - Endpoints documented in Swagger
  - Request/response examples for all entities missing
- Validation Coverage
  - Validation exists for all entities
  - More comprehensive validation rules needed
- Database Optimization
  - Using Prisma migrations and select for some queries
  - Indexes and select usage could be improved
- Environment Configuration
  - Separate configs for different environments could be improved
- Database Migrations
  - Migrations are present, but documentation could be improved

## ❌ Not Implemented
- Pagination and Filtering
  - No pagination, filtering, or sorting on list endpoints
- Testing
  - No unit or integration tests for entities/endpoints
  - No test framework (Jest/Mocha) set up
  - No test databases for different environments
- API Versioning
  - No API versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/users`)
- Rate Limiting
  - No rate limiting (e.g., `express-rate-limit`)
- Dependency Injection
  - No DI container (e.g., `awilix`)
- Health Check Endpoint
  - No `/health` endpoint for monitoring (health route exists, but may need improvement for monitoring)
- Dockerize Your Application
  - No `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml`
- API Security
  - No `helmet` for Express security
  - No CSRF protection
  - No explicit input sanitization
- Code Linting and Formatting
  - No ESLint or Prettier config detected
