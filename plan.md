# Backend Development Plan

## 1. ✓ Modularize Your Codebase [IMPLEMENTED]
- [x] Organize code into modules (user, family, tasks, shopping, cars, etc.)
- [x] Each module has:
  - [x] Routes
  - [x] Controllers
  - [x] Services
  - [x] Validations

## 2. ✓ Entity Coverage [IMPLEMENTED]
- [x] Category
- [x] Goal
- [x] Car
- [x] ShoppingItem
- [x] Note
- [x] Recipe
- [x] SavedShoppingList
- [x] SavedShoppingListItem
- [x] CarLocationHistory

## 3. ✓ API Documentation [IMPLEMENTED]
- [x] Swagger/OpenAPI configured
- [x] All endpoints documented in `/docs/swagger/`

## 4. ✓ Route Registration [IMPLEMENTED]
- [x] All routes registered in main router (server.js)

## 5. ⚠️ Standardized API Responses [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]
- [ ] Standardize API responses for all endpoints (success/error)

## 6. ⚠️ RBAC Enforcement [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]
- [ ] Enforce role-based access control for all protected endpoints

## 7. ⚠️ Pagination and Filtering [TO DO]
- [ ] Add pagination/filtering/sorting to all list endpoints

## 8. ⚠️ Testing Coverage [TO DO]
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests for all entities and endpoints

## 9. ⚠️ Error Handling [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]
- [x] Global error handler middleware exists
- [ ] Custom error classes (`ApiError`, `NotFoundError`) missing
- [ ] HTTP status codes not fully standardized

## 10. ⚠️ API Response Format [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]
- [x] Some endpoints use standardized responses
- [ ] Standardize API responses for all endpoints

## 11. ⚠️ Documentation Coverage [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]
- [x] All endpoints documented in Swagger
- [ ] Add request/response examples for all entities

## 12. ⚠️ Validation Coverage [PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]
- [x] Validation for all entities
- [ ] Add more comprehensive validation rules

## 13. ⚠️ Service Layer Coverage [IMPLEMENTED]
- [x] Service files for all entities

## 14. ⚠️ Controller Coverage [IMPLEMENTED]
- [x] Controller files for all entities

## 15. ⚠️ Route Coverage [IMPLEMENTED]
- [x] Route files for all entities

## 16. Suggestions for Further Improvements
- Add OpenAPI/Swagger UI endpoint for easier API exploration
- Add request logging middleware for debugging
- Add automated deployment scripts
- Add monitoring/alerting for production
